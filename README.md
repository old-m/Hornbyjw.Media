A lightweight web API built to serve media to my website, which is a static web app and I'd rather not package every single media item at each site update. 

### Usage

It's a Visual Studio project which can be run locally if the launchSettings.json file is edited to include the requisite environment variables (and the user is authenticated to an account able to access the Blob Storage account).
